# Put your files where they belong without lifting a finger.\*

Sortbox is a magic folder in your Dropbox that moves files saved to it to
their correct location based on sorting rules that *you* create. Neat!

Like email filters, for your Dropbox.

\* You need to define your own sorting rules. Offer may not be combined with other offers.
