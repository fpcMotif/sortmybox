# Put your Dropbox files where they belong without lifting a finger.\*

Like email filters, for your Dropbox.

Hunting for folders in Finder (or Explorer) sucks. Save all your files
in the Sortbox folder in your Dropbox, and Sortbox will automatically
move them based on sorting rules you create. 

\* You need to define your own sorting rules. Offer may not be combined with other offers.
